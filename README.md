Final project for cs 147 computer graphics

1-Estimate how many hours you spent on the final project
I would say about 12 hours. I spent about 4 hours learning the ins and outs of audio, 3 hours with three.js, and about 5 putting everything together.


2-Briefly (2-3 sentences) describe what you learned through completing your final project
I learned a lot! I had to really push my javascript skills. I learned how to take in files, use audio, three.js, and a bunch of other random things along the journey.

3-Outof a scale from 0 â€“100,give a proposed grade for your project. While I will be the final evaluator of your efforts, I would like you to self-assess your effort here. Add a few sentences that explains your score
100. I ran out of time to perfect it. If I would've had more time I would have gotten experimented much more within three.js and made it look way better/more interesting. But there were a bunch of challenging moving pieces to figure out, and I spent more than the required amount of time on my project.
